# The Stanford BPSM Petromod Toolbox

This is an effort to automate creation and modification of models used in the Schlumberger PetroMod software. 
Currently, it is focused on modifying the lithologies.

## What has been done?
Lithology file can be read in Matlab and parsed into an easily modifiable tables.

## How to start
Please check out the power point presentation. It includes important information of how the data is organized.

## What is next?
Anshuman: he will start making some functions to modify some of the parameters that are needed for his work. 
Mustafa: finish of the writer so that the lithologies file can be written back in PetroMod format.

## This is input, how about output?
We will investigate the currently available python scripts and functionality that are available as part of the open simulator in PetroMod. This might allow us to export the data automatically after running the simulation.
